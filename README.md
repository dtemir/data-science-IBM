# IBM Data Science Professional Certification

This repository serves as a way for me to document my experience with the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). 
The program proved to be a great introduction to the field of Applied Data Science. 
The program has a lot of hands-on activities and interactive labs, which is an effective medium for learning.


By taking the course, you will learn useful **tools**, like **Jupyter Notebook** and **RStudio**.
You will also get experience with the **libraries** like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Folium**, **Scikit-Learn**, and others.
Most importantly, you will accomplish interesting **projects** like **Random Album Generator**, **Predicting Housing Prices**, and **Building a Classifier Model**.
