The **[final assignment](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dtemir/data-science-IBM/blob/main/databases/Week4_2_PeerAssign.ipynb)** was to use real-world data (Chicago Census, Public Schools, and Crime Data) to answer questions based on the information from all three databases using SQL. 

### Week 1 - Introduction to Databases and Basic SQL

In Week 1 you will be introduced to databases. You will create a database instance on the cloud. You will learn some of the basic SQL statements. You will also write and practice basic SQL hands-on on a live database.

### Week 2 - Advanced SQL

By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Utilize string patterns and ranges to search data and how to sort and group data in result sets. (2) Compose nested queries and execute select statements to access data from multiple tables.

### Week 3 - Accessing Databases using Python

After completing the lessons in this week, you will learn how to explain the basic concepts related to using Python to connect to databases and then create tables, load data, query data using SQL, and analyze data using Python.

### Week 4 - Week 4: Course Assignment

As a hands-on Data Science assignment, you will be working with multiple real world datasets for the city of Chicago. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data scientist would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.
